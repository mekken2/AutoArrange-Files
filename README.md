# TODO:

- [ ] Add a sleep timer and Make it run in the background(in all of those folders where it is copied)
- [ ] Save the moved file data into a database and ignore those files (or check only current dir.)
- [ ] Make only those folders which are needed as per the Extension requirement
- [ ] Make it to ignore itself and not get moved somewhere else
- [ ] Convert the .py file to .exe to run anywhere just by double click
